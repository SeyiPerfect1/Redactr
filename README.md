REDACTR
As part of the AltschoolAfrica holiday challenge, Redactr is one of the task given which entails scrambling some words from a body of text content.


SCENARIO
The app helps people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of the text they don’t want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste some content into a form field and then specify the words they need to be scrambled (using another field). The user is allowed to specify more than one word (separated by space or comma) to be scrambled.


OUTCOME
After clicking a “Redact Now” button, the app scans through the original text and replaces the specified words to be scrambled with asterisks (i.e ***)


ADVANCED FEATURES
-The app allows the user to specify what to use in replacing the words, so that the app can do the scrambling with what the user provides, be it asterisks, questions marks, dashes, underscores, or even other words.

-The app display how many words were scanned, how many characters were scrambled in total, how long it took (in seconds) to complete the scrambling task.

-On filling out the form, the app request for the date of birth of the user(optional). This helps in calculating the age of the user. If the user did not provide his/her/their date of birth or if the age of the user is less than 18years, the app scramble all the matched words. If the user 18 years or above 18years of age, the app scrambles the even positioned characters in the matched words e.g Sex is scrambled to s*x, Whore is scrambled to W*o*e etc.
